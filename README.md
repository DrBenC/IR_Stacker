This script will input IR spectra from .txt files (as output by Shimadzu Spectrometers).

For combinations of materials, i.e. the filename ("Pd44_glycine.txt") the software will compare the combination to each constituent.
("glycine.txt" and "Pd44"). It outputs a .png graph in both transmittance and absorbance, as well as peak picking each graph.
